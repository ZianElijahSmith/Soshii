# Soshii - On Haitus

Soshii was a Social Media Bot that would manage all your social media accounts for you.

You would give it the username and password for all your social media accounts so it had access, and then, whenever you wanted to post something, you could pass your social media post 1 time to Soshii, and Soshii would post it to all your accounts, twitter, instagram, facebook, etc.

There are some programs that work similar to this, but they cost money, and Soshii was going to be free.

# Update
Unforuntately, in February of 2023, TwitterDev announced their API would no longer be free. They will be charging $100 per month.

Because of this, Soshii has been discontinued and the code has been removed. The project is currently on Haitus/Pause.
The project may be developed again in the future. Unsure.
