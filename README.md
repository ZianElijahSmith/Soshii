# Soshii - On Haitus

Soshii was a Social Media Bot that would manage all your social media accounts for you.

You would give it the username and password for all your social media accounts so it had access, and then, whenever you wanted to post something, you could pass your social media post 1 time to Soshii, and Soshii would post it to all your accounts, twitter, instagram, facebook, etc.

Since other Social Media companies tend to follow decisions of what Twitter does, we might see other Social media platforms charging for their API as well.

There are some programs that work similar to the idea of Soshii, but they cost money and don't work with as many social media platforms. Soshii was going to be free and work with as many platforms as possible.

# Update 1.0
Unforuntately, in February of 2023, TwitterDev announced their API would no longer be free. They will be charging $100 per month.

Because of this, Soshii has been discontinued and the code has been removed. The project is currently on Haitus/Pause.
The project may be developed again in the future. Unsure.

# Update 1.1

TwitterDev announced that although they will charge for their most recent API, they will probably give free access to their other API.
Waiting for this development to finish before moving forward, as Soshii will rely on the API's of each Social media to use.
